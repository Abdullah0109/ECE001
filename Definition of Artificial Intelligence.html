    <p style="color:white"> Throughout computer science, artificial intelligence, also called
    machine intelligence, is the intelligence displayed by computers, as opposed to
    the actual intelligence demonstrated by humans and animals. Artificial intelligence
    is described as the "smart agents" study: any system that knows its environment
    and takes steps that increase its chances of achieving its goals successfully.
    Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is sometimes used to describe 
    devices (or computers) that imitate the "cognitive" functions people associate
    with the human mind, such as "thinking" and "problem solving."</p>
